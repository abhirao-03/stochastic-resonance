# DURING MEETING

Fixed our epsilon and simplified polynomial stuff.

Behaviour as expected now

### Next steps:

Simulate multiple paths

Implement instant switch potential.

Implement the Lebesgue measure for the wells.

Write up convergence of E-M and Milstein scheme.

try to think about:
code a few things about the convergence stuff
how to design stuff to observe the difference.


recommendation:
finish coding/most of the coding that takes a long time to run before christmas.
