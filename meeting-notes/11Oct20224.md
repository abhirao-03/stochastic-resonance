Action steps

Look at simulating whole paths through matrices and vectors instead of 1 dimensional
(FASTER)

Implement implicit methods as well. In one chapter compare the different methods so add more methods, stability, convergence rate(go into how fast they converge WITH THEORY)

Test methods with geometric Brownian motion

Regards to theory:

In the paper;

Optimal tuning
With epsilon(noise) T(time horizon period)
If the relation of those two has the right proportion(lambda)
If lambda smaller than the shallow well; we always stay in the well

If lambda larger than shallow well; we almost all the time spend in deeper well

Verify theorem 1 numerically
Do your simulations and verify this is true
Write those functions(lebesgue measures)

Lebesgue measure —  length of integral


Time it takes to leave a well is exponentially distributed (jumps from one well to another)
- Work with it and justify it
- Memory-less property with Markov chains

The jumps are Markov chains
How long going from one well to another
Build up statistics from that and check for distribution.
Likely to do statistics and QQ plots, transformation of emperical CDF, standard tests on distributions

Applying the CDF to the random variable make it uniform (this is explored for the exponential random variable)
There are tests for uniform distribution(those tests are comparatively easy and well developed)

Look for proof online(exponential distribution is the only continuous memory less distribution)

Possible extension(3 well potential) — discrete chain Markov chain with jump time probabilities. Two possibilities where two jump, which jump occurs first. Minimum of two exponentially distributed RV which is exponentially distributed.

1. Go into the paper whether they state it(hard read, difficult)
2. Argue this yourself with Markov chains
    1. Show exponential distribution is memory less
    2. Proof can be found online
    3. Prolly chatgpt can find it
