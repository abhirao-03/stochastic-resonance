## Pre Meeting Notes and Discoveries

Weird behaviour with $dt$ and $\epsilon$ when observing sin potential vs polynomial potential, similarly it explodes with our instant switch potential.

Polynomial potential requires much finer $dt$ otherwise it explodes to NaN.
Any thoughts on how we would handle this?

Started on write up, show him a snippet and ask about language and how we should be presenting our information(audience, depth into SDEs, etc.)

Have yet to start on investigating theorem 1 and its epsilon value assignment.
