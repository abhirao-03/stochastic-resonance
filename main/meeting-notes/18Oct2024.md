# Meeting Notes

Look for milstein method derivation
And try to find the discrepancy with derivative

Check results from website above


Argument to make is that we CAN reduce it to a two state Markov chains
Then everything else follows

To get from A to B in the potential you always have to get through the stuff in the middle

You start out somewhere and you do something either you end up in the other well or you return your minimum

One of the two will happen with probability 1 until you wait until infinity

One of the two DEF WILL HAPPEN

Which one does happen? If you jump to the other well then done u jumped

Other case

U return to the starting point you are in the same setting as before
Therefore
The probability jumping in the 10 minutes then is the same as before since nothing happened 10 min ago
The time will take exponentially longer then.

Because jump times are exponential
When we are close to the well we are in the well anyway
So might as well collapse it into the two states of one well or the other well

Which gives us a Markov chain



You are in a well
Deepest point

Time until you return to that point (any point not just well)

Seems like we need to do some handwaving to get the argument running


The drift is always pushing towards minimum of well

Argue with results from Theorem 1 in paper
- That we spent time only in minimum of the well so being outside is very unlikely
- I’m in the minimum of the well with very high probability anyway
- If I didn’t jump now then same situation as before.


The whole well is one point and you always get pushed towards the minimum
Write it down formally and theorem 1 will probably help


‘Just looks ugly, this argument’ - SE



Simulate a ton of trajectories
Specifically when well switches abruptly
For a good level of noise you are nearly always in the deepest well
Only at the time of switch you jump a bit late



Look at implicit methods and their convergence rates
CONVERGENCE rates of numerical methods as a whole
In the long run perhaps invest more time into tracking convergence of numerical methods
Topic is vaguely connected to stochastic resonance
Could put a big chapter into dissertation if we want to




Next steps may be:
Milstein derivation and implementation
Implement the stochastic sde from paper
There are two in the paper
One with sine included, one where the wells switch rapidly
One where wells go slowly over time(sine function)

Implement different potential wells (2 well and 3 well) (see if behaviour changes but prolly not)

Check theorem 1
Ok in deepest well,
Ok count how many times we are here.

Checking exponential distribution
Do the proofing for jumps

Function that go through a simulated sample path
Okay here it changes the well
Okay it took this long.


Try to come up with some additional ideas SO U DONT HAVE TO DO THEORETICAL MATHS
