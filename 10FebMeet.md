we expect to see some deviation from theoretical because we are dealing with samples

how much could this deviation be?

usually what u calc in those tests u see
how unlikely is it to see what we observed here compared to theoreitcal


when u 



plots with different parameters
delta change etc. etc.


our numerical method and the parameters

compare against explicit solutions and showcase our numerical method
validate our numerical method

now that we've spoken about the validity of our method, move on to applying these methods on the problem at hand
